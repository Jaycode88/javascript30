    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2)
    age = 200
    console.log(age, age2)

    let name = 'wes';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2)
    name = 'Wesley';
    console.log(name, name2)

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];


    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team)

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    team[3] = 'Lux';


    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice(); //this will make a new array and copy the first array into it
    
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
const team4 = [...players];

const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
  const captain = person; //this does not copy it refers to original
  captain.number = 99;    // any changes would also be made to original array

    // how do we take a copy instead?
 const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99});// this creates new object assigns it the values of the person object then adds its own value
    // new feature .... the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person}; //This is exactly like the es6 array spread used above..
console.log(cap3)
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
const wes = {
    name: 'Wes',
    age:100,
    social: {
        Twitter: '@wesbos',
        Facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
    }
}
console.log(wes)

// to copy the object
const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);// this creates new object in which changes can be made without changing the original object
// Another way to do it but unsuggested reffered to as "the poor mans deep clone"
const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
// JSON stringify copys the original object into a string
//parse then takes that string and turns it back into an object
